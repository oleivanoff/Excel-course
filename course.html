    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate & Sky -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tab-based single-page application (SPA) is chosen for optimal user experience. The structure includes: 1) A 'Home' tab for introduction and progress visualization. 2) A '21-Day Plan' tab with an interactive accordion for weeks and days, presenting daily lessons in a clear, focused manner. 3) A 'Mastery Toolkit' tab to house resources like the influencer matrix and YouTube channels. This segmented structure prevents overwhelming the user with a long scroll, allows direct navigation to any content, and creates a logical, task-oriented flow. The interactive plan encourages engagement and provides a sense of progression. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: 21-Day learning plan. Goal: Guide and track progress. Viz/Method: Donut Chart (Chart.js) for progress, HTML/CSS Accordion for the plan. Interaction: Clicking a day updates the view and conceptually the chart. Justification: Visual progress is motivating; an accordion organizes dense content effectively. Report Info: Influencer list. Goal: Provide actionable resources. Viz/Method: Interactive HTML Table. Interaction: Clickable links. Justification: More usable and professional than static text. All choices support the tabbed structure and avoid SVG/Mermaid. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
